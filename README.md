## Features
#### Custom Headers
The extension modifies the request headers sent by your browser by adding or removing specific headers based on your preferences. The following headers can be customized:

-   **Save-Data Header**: Adds the "Save-Data" header with the value "on" to indicate that you want to optimize data usage.
    
-   **DNT (Do Not Track) Header**: Adds the "DNT" header with the value "1" to indicate your preference for not being tracked.
    
-   **User-Agent Header**: Changes the user-agent header to mimic Firefox Mobile. This can help you view mobile versions of websites on your desktop.
    
-   **Referer Header Removal**: Removes the "Referer" header, which contains information about the previous webpage visited. This helps protect your privacy by preventing websites from tracking your browsing history through the referer header.
    
-   **Cookie Header Removal**: Removes the "Cookie" header, which contains information about stored cookies. This feature enhances privacy by preventing websites from accessing your stored cookies.
    
-   **Accept-Language Header Removal**: Removes the "Accept-Language" header, which specifies the preferred language of the browser. By removing this header, websites won't be able to detect your language preference.

#### Additional Settings

The extension provides additional settings that allow you to further customize your browsing experience:

-   **Block JavaScript**: Allows you to block JavaScript execution on webpages. This feature can enhance security and protect against certain types of web-based attacks.
    
-   **Block Media Downloads**: Blocks the downloading of images and videos on webpages. This can help reduce data usage and improve page loading times.
